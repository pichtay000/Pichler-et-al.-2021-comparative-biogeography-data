Repository Description: Data files associated with 'Comparative biogeography of volant and non-volant mammals in a 
temperate island archipelago' for publication in Ecosphere.

Authors: Taylor R. Pichler, Elyse C. Mallinger, Morgan J. Farmer, Megan J. Morrison, Bijit Khadka,

Data file name: “Pichler_et_al_comparative_biogeography_acoustic_bat_diversity_data.csv”

island: The island in the Apostle Islands archipelago, Wisconsin, USA where
all subsequent data columns were calculated. Includes the adjacent mainland area (“Mainland”) 
managed by Apostle Islands National Lakeshore.

bat_sr: Species richness for the volant mammal (Chiroptera) subset observed from acoustic bat monitoring 
(data from 2016-2018) on an island or the mainland. 

bat_eh: The exponential of the Shannon-Weiner index for the volant mammal (Chiroptera) subset observed from acoustic bat monitoring 
(data from 2016-2018) on an island or the mainland.

bat_spev: Species evenness for the medium-large mammal subset observed from volant mammal (Chiroptera) subset observed from acoustic bat monitoring 
(data from 2016-2018) on an island or the mainland.

size_km2: The area in square kilometers of an island. We entered a null (“NA”) value for the mainland.

aveftch_km: The isolation in kilometers of an island. We calculated an isolation metric based on the 
average distance to the nearest shoreline in eight cardinal and inter-cardinal directions for every 30-m pixel 
within 100 m of the shoreline for the island. We entered a null (“NA”) value for the mainland.

Data file name: “Pichler_et_al_comparative_biogeography_camera_diversity_data.csv”

island: The island in the Apostle Islands archipelago, Wisconsin, USA where
all subsequent data columns were calculated. Includes the adjacent mainland area (“Mainland”) 
managed by Apostle Islands National Lakeshore.

cam_sr: Species richness for the medium-large mammal subset observed from camera trap surveys 
(data from 2014-2018) on an island or the mainland. 

cam_eh: The exponential of the Shannon-Weiner index for the medium-large mammal subset observed from 
camera trap surveys (data from 2014-2018) on an island or the mainland.

cam_spev: Species evenness for the medium-large mammal subset observed from camera trap surveys 
(data from 2014-2018) on an island or the mainland.

size_km2: The area in square kilometers of an island. We entered a null (“NA”) value for the mainland.

aveftch_km: The isolation in kilometers of an island. We calculated an isolation metric based on the 
average distance to the nearest shoreline in eight cardinal and inter-cardinal directions for every 30-m pixel 
within 100 m of the shoreline for the island. We entered a null (“NA”) value for the mainland.

Data file name: “Pichler_et_al_comparative_biogeography_small_mammal_diversity_data.csv”

island: The island in the Apostle Islands archipelago, Wisconsin, USA where
all subsequent data columns were calculated. Includes the adjacent mainland area (“Mainland”) 
managed by Apostle Islands National Lakeshore.

smam_sr: Species richness observed from the small mammal subset observed from live trapping (data from 2017-2020) 
on an island or the mainland.

smam_eh: The exponential of the Shannon-Weiner index for the small mammal subset observed from live trapping 
(data from 2017-2020) on an island or the mainland.

smam_spev: Species evenness for the small mammal subset observed from live trapping 
(data from 2017-2020) on an island or the mainland.

aveftch_km: The isolation in kilometers of an island. We calculated an isolation metric based on the 
average distance to the nearest shoreline in eight cardinal and inter-cardinal directions for every 30-m pixel 
within 100 m of the shoreline for the island. We entered a null (“NA”) value for the mainland.


Data file name: “Pichler_et_al_comparative_biogeography_nonvolant_mammal_presence_data.csv”

island: The island in the Apostle Islands archipelago, Wisconsin, USA where species presence 
is assigned. Includes the adjacent mainland area (“Mainland”) managed by Apostle Islands National Lakeshore.

presence: Whether a respective species was detected (presence= “1”) or not detected (presence= “0”) 
on an island or the mainland during field surveys.

species: The species for which data values in “presence” and “body_mass_g” columns are assigned. Species code key:

ERDO – Erethizon dorsatum (porcupine), GLVO – Glaucomys volans (southern flying squirrel), LEAM – Lepus americanus (snowshoe hare), 
LYRU – Lynx rufus (bobcat), PRLO – Procyon lotor (raccoon), MAAM – Martes americana (American marten), MIPE – Microtus pennsylvanicus (meadow vole), 
MUER – Mustela erminea (short-tailed weasel), MUFR – Mustela frenata (long-tailed weasel), MYGA – Myodes gapperi (red-backed vole),

body_mass_g: The reported body mass in grams of a species. 

winter_active: Whether a species was reported active during winter (winter_active= “1”) or 
not active during winter (winter_active= “0”).
